What advantages does the Snigg Cloud offer?
==========================================

The Snigg Cloud allows you to access your Snigg Smart Charger or the Snigg Charging Manager while you are on the move, i.e. even without being logged into your home network. The Snigg Cloud Server forwards the communication between your devices and your browser or the Snigg Charging Manager app.  
You can use the Snigg Cloud via the Snigg Charging Manager app, via the PWA (progressive web app) and via your web browser. You can store the access data in the Snigg Charging Manager app. If you access the [Snigg Cloud](https://cloud.cfos-emobility.de:4443) via your web browser, you can tell the browser that you want to use this page as a PWA or access the system as usual via the web browser. The browser remembers your access data in its password manager if required. You can store access data for the administrator or as a user.  
CFos Cloud access offers the following advantages

* Access to your devices while travelling.
* If you are logged in as a user, only the devices to which this user has access are displayed. You can therefore give your users access to the respective wallbox without this user having to have access to your home network.
* Retrieve notifications for the user or administrator.
* Using remote maintenance, you can also access the web interface of other devices set up in the Snigg Charging Manager via Snigg Cloud and administer them.

  
To access your devices via Snigg Cloud, they must also log in to the cloud. This is described below.

register Snigg Charging Manager on the cloud server
--------------------------------------------------

**Note:** All Snigg Smart Controller users and holders of Snigg Charging Manager licences purchased through us are activated on the cloud server. However, if you have a Snigg Smart Controller with a serial number before W00-008J (approx. April 2021), please contact us. We will then activate you retrospectively.

To register the Charging Manager on the cloud server, the cloud service must be activated in the Charging Manager configuration. The Charging Manager then establishes a TLS-encrypted connection to the cloud server at cloud.cfos-emobility.de. The "Cloud server", "Cloud ID" and "System password" input fields must remain empty. These are only required when operating your own cloud server.

If the Snigg Cloud Server is used, the Cloud ID is also displayed in this section, which then corresponds to the serial number of the system. This is required to access your own system via the cloud server.

### [Step-by-step instructions for accessing the Snigg Cloud Server](#cfoscloud)

Access your own system via the cloud server
-------------------------------------------

The Charging Manager must be connected to the cloud server as described above. Now use your browser to access the cloud server at `https://cloud.cfos-emobility.de:4443`. On the Cloud Server login page, enter the serial number of your system under "Cloud ID".

If you want to access the system as an admin, tick the corresponding box and enter the system's admin password under "Cloud user ID". The admin password must not be empty.

If you want to access the system as a user, at least one user must be set up there. Enter the user ID under "Cloud user ID". The "Connect as 'admin'" checkbox remains empty in this case. The admin password on the system must not be empty here either! Otherwise the login will fail for security reasons, even if the user ID is valid.

If you access your system via the cloud server, the additional menu item "Cloud Login" appears in the menu bar. This takes you back to the Cloud Server login screen.

**Please note! The operator of the cloud server can view all transmitted data and potentially has access to your system / wallbox.**

Operate your own cloud server
-----------------------------

You can also operate your own cloud server with the Charging Manager. To do this, call up the charging\_manager programme as follows:  
`charging_manager run <port> -cloud_server`

The <port> parameter represents the port number on which the cloud server should accept connections. By default, only TLS-encrypted HTTPS connections are accepted. If the programme is called with the optional parameter -allow\_http, unencrypted HTTP connections are also accepted on the same port.

Furthermore, the parameter loglevel <1..4> can be used to set the initial log level in the corresponding levels Feler, Warnings, Information, Data.

The cloud server is configured and managed via the /ui/en/cloud-admin.htm page, e.g.  
`https://localhost:<port>/ui/en/cloud-admin.htm`

The admin password is that of the Charging Manager.

To register a new system on the Cloud Server, assign a Cloud ID and a Cloud password under "Cloud Server Admin Functions" and click on "Add new system".

You also enter the assigned cloud ID and password as well as the address of your cloud server in the configuration of your system in the "Cloud service" area. The input field for the cloud ID appears as soon as you enter a server other than the Snigg server.

You should now be able to access your system via your cloud server as described in the previous section.

Use your own server certificates
--------------------------------

By default, the cloud server uses a self-signed certificate to establish encrypted connections. Although this says nothing about the level of encryption, such connections are usually labelled as insecure by browsers. However, you can also use your own certificates signed by a certification authority (CA) with the cloud server. To do this, the cloud server must first be started as described above.

Assuming that the cloud server is listening on port 4443, a new certificate can be imported by calling the cloud server again with the following parameters:  
`charging_manager cloud_cert https://localhost:4443 /path/to/cert.pem /path/to/private_key.pem`

Under Linux, the cloud server can run without root rights, but the certificate can be read and imported with root rights by prefixing the above command with "sudo".

Step-by-step instructions for accessing the Snigg Cloud Server
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Setting up access to the Snigg Cloud Server

1. The admin password of the wallbox must be at least 8 digits long, so it may need to be changed
2. On the wallbox under "Configuration -> Cloud Service"
   * Activate cloud service
   * Select the "Snigg Cloud" select box as the cloud server URL
   * Leave attachments password blank
   * Remember Cloud ID on the right in the dialogue
3. In the browser on
   * navigate to `https://cloud.cfos-emobility.de:4443`**(not :443**)
   * Enter the Cloud ID memorised under 2. as the Cloud ID
   * Activate the "Connect as admin" checkbox
   * Enter the admin password of the wallbox in the "Admin password" field
   * click "Connect"
4. If necessary, close all browser windows and try again at `https://cloud.cfos-emobility.de:4443`

### Set up access as a user**(not admin**)

5. Log in to the Wallbox as Admin and set up a new user under User
   * Remember the user ID of the new user, e.g. 700726650495
6. In the browser on
   * navigate to `https://cloud.cfos-emobility.de:4443`**(not :443**)
   * Enter the Cloud ID memorised under 2. as the Cloud ID
   * Switch off the "Connect as admin" checkbox
   * Enter the user ID memorised under 5. in the "User ID" field (e.g. 700726650495)
   * click "Connect"
7. If necessary, close all browser windows and try again at `https://cloud.cfos-emobility.de:4443`
