# Virtual measuring points

The "Virtual Metering Point" meter type allows a virtual metering point to be set up. Each virtual metering point consists of a consumer and a producer. Consumption and generation are balanced every quarter of an hour. A consumer draws its electricity from the grid. The Snigg Charging Manager takes into account the adjustable price information (fixed price or variable tariffs). If there is a generator in the system, the generated electricity can be (proportionately) allocated to this consumer. Example: The consumer uses 10 kWh in the quarter-hour interval and the solar system generates 3 kWh during this time. The Charging Manager then calculates 7 kWh of grid consumption and 3 kWh of PV electricity for this virtual measuring point. With such virtual measuring points, individual participants in the system can be billed with a configurable solar share. This can be useful for tenant electricity or separate billing of wallboxes, for example. Virtual metering points are designed so that you can bill several consumers in conjunction with one or more generators.

Legal questions (e.g. whether you need to become an energy supplier) must be clarified with a specialised lawyer. We cannot provide any information on this.

## The following parameters can be set for a virtual measuring point

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Formula for consumption meters | The kWh of the meter that measures the actual consumption of the measuring point must be entered here as the formula, e.g. **M5.import\_wh**. |
| Formula for producer counters | The kWh of the meter that measures the generation to be credited for this consumer must be entered here as the formula, e.g. **M7.import\_wh**. |
| Priority | Here you define the priority with which the generation current is distributed to the virtual measuring points. Virtual measuring points with higher priorities are considered first, i.e. larger values have a higher priority. |
| Share of generation (e.g. values from 0 to 1) | Typically **1**, if all virtual measuring points involved in this generation meter should have the same share of solar power within the same priority. Otherwise, individual consumers can also have a lower share. |
| Factor for grid procurement costs | Typically **1**. if you want to charge an additional levy, you can enter **1.1** for a 10% surcharge, for example. |
| Costs of electricity generation | Specified in cent per kWh. This is where you set the price for the electricity generated by your system. |
| Mail recipient | If you enter a valid e-mail address (and your Charging Manager is configured to send e-mails), this recipient will receive the monthly billing data as a .CSV file. |

Virtual measuring points also contain a "Consumption data" button in the settings. The consumption of the current month, the previous month and the same month of the previous year is displayed here.  
  
We have also added a button with this function for wallboxes and under the user settings because this cost information could also be of interest for charging points.

## Allocation of the electricity generated

The Snigg Charging Manager overlays consumption and generation on a quarter-hourly basis. It logs the corresponding data in a .CSV file for verification purposes. You can download this under "Configuration" -> "Files" and delete it if necessary.

The generated electricity is distributed as follows: The Charging Manager considers virtual metering points with the highest priority first and distributes the generation (kWh) to the loads according to the set "share of generation". The remaining energy is then distributed to virtual measuring points with the second-highest priority, and so on.

### Example

6 kWh were generated in the interval, virtual measuring point 1 (VP1) has a share of generation of 1 and consumption of 5 kWh. Virtual measuring point 2 (VP2) has a share of generation of 1 and consumption of 3 kWh.  
The Charging Manager splits the generation as follows: VP1 and VP2 receive 3 kWh. VP1 still draws 2 kWh from the grid, VP2 still 0 kWh. This means that the generation is completely used up. No generation is credited to virtual measuring points with a lower priority.  
If VP 2 in the above example has a "share of generation" of 0.5, the distribution is as follows: VP 1 receives 4 kWh, VP 2 receives 2 kWh. VP1 still receives 1 kWh from the grid, VP2 still receives 1 kWh.
