User administration
===================

The user administration of the Snigg Charging Manager is intended for both admins and users. A user can change his settings and add new RFID cards by entering his user ID. As a user, you do not need to call the admin if you want to teach a new RFID card or change its configuration. The admin can add users and list and edit all users.

Each new user receives a unique ID from the Charging Manager. The name can be displayed in the tile when loading (can be deactivated). In addition, the user can set whether his or her tile should be visible to other users (the admin can always see the tile). In the wallbox assignment, the admin sets at which of the wallboxes the user may charge. As soon as at least one user is assigned to a wallbox, charging at this box must be authorised with PIN or RFID. Charging rules can be defined per user, which the user can configure and activate or deactivate himself. The charging rules assigned to the wallbox (under the wallbox settings) can only be changed or activated and deactivated by the admin. If user and wallbox charging rules exist, the lower charging current always applies.

You can either add an RFID card by entering a unique PIN (as long as possible) or by learning. Teach-in is done by pressing the "Learn" button and then starting a transaction within 1 minute, i.e. plugging in the car, putting on the RFID. This is possible with OCPP and/or wallboxes that deliver an RFID to the Snigg Charging Manager via Modbus or other protocols. An RFID can also have a name that is displayed in the tile instead of the user name, if available. In addition to charging authorisation, other functions can be assigned to an RFID card. Such cards can overwrite the phases used and the maximum charging current at the beginning and during the charging process. In addition, you can activate and deactivate charging or the user's charging rules by placing the card on the wallbox. Note: Some wallboxes only transmit the RFID at the beginning of the charging process. The Snigg Smart Charger can also report newly inserted RFID cards during the charging process. Many wallboxes only deliver an RFID to the Charging Manager once you have taught the RFID in the wallbox itself. To do this, follow the wallbox-specific instructions for learning RFID cards.

As an admin, you can also assign a priority to the user. This priority overwrites the priority set in the wallbox as soon as the Charging Manager recognises that this user is active by inserting an RFID card or entering a PIN. You can also assign a charging budget to the user. Charging is deactivated as soon as the budget is used up. For more information, see [Charging with kWh Budgets](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/budgets.htm).

Settings per user
=================

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | User name. It can be displayed in the tile during loading. It appears in the list of charging processes |
| User ID | . The user can use this to authorise themselves. Should be kept secret. Appears in the CSV file with the loading processes. |
| Allow name display | Here the user can set whether his name should be displayed in the tile when he has plugged in the car. |
| Show wallbox | Here the user can set whether their tile should be displayed on the start page. If not, it will only be displayed if the user logs in on the start page with their user ID. |
| Wallbox assignment | The user may only charge at wallboxes for which a tick is set in the assignment. |
| Priority | Charging priority for load management. "Maintain" means that the priority is not changed when this user plugs in their car. Otherwise, the numerical priority that can be entered in the combo box is used as long as this user is charging. |
| Budget for the user | Budget in kWh or minutes. The same settings apply as for budgets for RFID cards. If no RFID card is inserted, the user budget applies, otherwise that of the RFID card. Further information on the [budgets](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/budgets.htm) |
| Add loading rules | The user can add charging rules here. The admin can add charging rules to the wallbox. If charging rules exist for the wallbox and for the user (or RFID), the Snigg Charging Manager takes the lower of the two resulting values. |
| Adding or learning RFID | RFIDs can be used to overwrite certain user settings and/or authorise loading. More on this under [RFID functions](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/rfid-functions.htm) |
