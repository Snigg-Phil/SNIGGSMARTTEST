# Instructions for some EVSEs, meters and inverters

## Devices that can be addressed with an IP address in the home network

Determine the address of the device in your router. Port 502 or 1502 is very often used for Modbus. For Snigg Power Brain devices, ports 4701, 4702 and 4703 are used, so set the address and the corresponding port in your router as the address, e.g. 192.168.2.111:502. Set the Modbus ID to the ID specified by the manufacturer for the device. **Note**: In some cases, you must activate Modbus (RTU or TCP) in the device to be set up. Also check which port and which Modbus ID are set there.

## Meters and inverters with two-wire connection (Modbus RTU or RS485), such as ABB B23, DTSU666, Eastron, EMH, Lovato, Orno, YTL, ZZ4 D513020, etc.

Select the appropriate meter type and wire contacts A to A and B to B using a two-wire line (telephone line / network cable) to create [a bus](/files/modbus-verkabelung.pdf). For cable lengths of 10 metres or more, we recommend terminating resistors of 120 ohms, 1/4 watt at both ends of the bus. As A and B are not standardised, you may have to swap the cores. Each device on the bus must have a unique ID, which you must enter in addition to the address. Enter COMx,baud,bits,parity,stops as the address, e.g. COM1,9600,8,N,1 where x is the COM port to which your two-wire line is connected: With the Snigg Snigg Smart Controller always COM1. For Windows and Raspberry you have to find out the COM port of your RS485 adapter. Baud, bits, parity, stops can be found in the instructions for the meter. For ABB usually 19200,8,N,1, for Eastron 9600,8,N,1, for Orno and ZZ4 D513020 9600,8,E,1. Each device on Modbus RTU (two-wire) must have a unique ID. If you operate several devices on one bus, you may have to change the ID in the devices. This can be done either using the operating buttons on the meter or with the "Modbus Test" UI in the Charging Manager under "Configuration".

##### ABB Terra (OCPP)

(OCPP instead of Modbus recommended) Log in to the [TerraConfig Service Portal](https://abb.installer.chargedot.com/) with your access data. Set up another OCPP server there. Enter any name that clearly describes the configuration. Select "ws" for unencrypted and "wss" for encrypted connections. If the charging manager and wallbox are located in the same local network, unencrypted connections are usually sufficient. If you select encrypted connections, make sure that the "OCPP Server TLS" field in the Charging Manager under "Settings" is set to "On" or "Recognise". Also make a note of the "OCPP Server Port" entered there (19520 by default). In TerraConfig, enter the IP address of the Charging Manager under URL, followed by a colon and the OCPP server port, e.g. 192.168.178.42:19520. Select "OCPP 1.6-J" as the protocol in TerraConfig. Save these settings.  
  
In the TerraConfig app, which you use to configure your wallbox, select the OCPP server profile you have just created in the OCPP settings, which should now appear in the list of available profiles.  
  
If you have not already done so, add a new wallbox in the Charging Manager. Select "EVSE with OCPP 1.6" as the device type. Under Address, enter the serial number of your wallbox, e.g. TACW2241234G5678. The ID field corresponds to the connector ID, always "1" for wallboxes with one connector. Save these settings.  
  
The first line in the tile for the created wallbox should initially display "Offline / Off". You can recognise a successful connection of the wallbox to the Charging Manager by the fact that this line changes to "Waiting / Off". Furthermore, "EVSE OCPP" is initially displayed at the bottom of the tile. After a successful connection, detailed information about the wallbox (manufacturer, model, firmware, serial number) is displayed there.

##### ABL eMH1

Here you need a two-wire connection with twisted cable (bell wire, network cable). In the housing of the eMH1 you will find an RJ12 socket, which is connected to RS485 on the circuit board. The (centre two) pins 3 and 4 are Modbus A and B. You therefore need an adapter from RJ12 to two-wire. As A and B are not specified for Modbus, you may have to swap the wires if the wallbox cannot be reached. Address is COM1,38400,8,E,1 (under Windows and Raspberry possibly another COM port, e.g. COM3). You may have to set the wallbox to "Standalone" in the ABL configuration programme confcab. The Modbus ID here can also be set to values from 1 to 16 if required.

##### ABL eMH3 and eM4 (OCPP)

These wallboxes should be connected via OCPP. They have 2 connectors, i.e. one wallbox tile must be set up per connector. The 2nd connector is 120 degrees phase-rotated. However, the wallbox does not inform the Charging Manager of this, so you must remember to set the phase rotation of the second connector to 120 degrees when setting it up.

##### Alfen Eve Single Pro-Line (OCPP)

(OCPP recommended instead of Modbus) In the OCPP configuration of the wallbox, the IP address of the Snigg Charging Manager (e.g. 192.168.178.42) and the OCPP server port set therein (e.g. 19520) are specified as follows: ws://192.168.178.42:19520/  
In addition, note the value entered in the configuration of the wallbox under "Customer Ident No.". Enter this in the Charging Manager in the device configuration in the "Address" field. Select "EVSE with OCPP 1.6" as the device type

##### Alpitronic Hypercharger (OCPP)

(OCPP instead of Modbus recommended) You must set the parameter "AllowMaxChargingProfile" to "true" in the OCPP configuration of the Hypercharger so that the Snigg Charging Manager can control the charging current via OCPP.

##### Alpitronic Hypercharger HYC400 (Modbus)

(OCPP recommended instead of Modbus) The Modbus TCP server must be activated and writing via Modbus must be permitted. You should set the failsafe timeout to 180sec or higher. In addition, the connector number, starting with 0, must be entered in the tile settings under "Connector".

##### Amperfied Heidelberg Wallbox Energy Control and Walther-Werke BASICEVO PRO

Modbus: Set all DIP switches and rotary switches to standard. Set the rotary switch for the maximum current on the main board to **5** (16A / 11kW). Set the desired Modbus slave ID with DIP S4 according to the table in the manual. Enter **COMx,19200,8,e,1** as the address in the Charging Manager **.** For the newer models connect.home, connect.business, connect.solar, the RFID card must be taught in the box so that it authorises charging. In the Charging Manager, do not create an RFID with the "Authorise charging" function for the user or assign it to the box.

##### Autoaid Intelligent and other EN Plus (OCPP)

Last successfully tested with firmware 1.1.805. Integration via OCPP. To set up the box, download the EVSE Mesh app from the App Store. Instead of the EN+ backend, the IP address and port of the Snigg Charging Manager must be specified. If the IP address of the Snigg Charging Manager is 192.168.2.100 and the port is 19520, you must enter the following in the Autoaid Wallbox: http://192.168.2.100 (unencrypted) and https://192.168.2.100 (encrypted). Port: 19520. ws://" or "wss://" may also work instead of "http://" or "https://". Encrypted connections are currently untested. In the Snigg Charging Manager, "EVSE with OCPP" must be selected as the device type and the OCPP Charging Point ID of the Autoaid Intelligent must be entered as the address. The Charge Point Id is the serial number of the wallbox starting with SN. It is displayed in the app.

##### Bauer BSM signing counter

For the Bauer BSM, select SunSpec as the device type, the COM port to which you have connected the 2-wire connection. Select 19200,8,E,1 as the interface parameter and 42 as the ID. If you have set other parameters in the meter, select these accordingly.

##### Bender, Ebee, Ensto Chago, Garo, Juice, Optec, Pion, Spelsberg (OCPP)

Wallboxes with Bender Controller can be integrated with OCPP. Enter the Charge Point ID as configured in the wallbox as the address. Enter the Connector ID as configured in the wallbox as the ID.

##### Snigg / YTL DEM4A Series Modbus

This meter can be installed in the Snigg Snigg Smart Charger or be external. The meter installed in the wallbox has the Modbus ID 101. External meters should have Modbus IDs starting with 1. If the meter cannot be addressed, follow the [instructions for Modbus cabling](https://www.cfos-emobility.de/files/modbus-verkabelung.pdf). Here are instructions on how to [correctly set up](https://www.cfos-emobility.de/network/antworten/wie-kann-ich-den-internen-modbus-zaehler-manuell-einrichten/) a [meter](https://www.cfos-emobility.de/network/antworten/wie-kann-ich-den-internen-modbus-zaehler-manuell-einrichten/) installed in the wallbox [again](https://www.cfos-emobility.de/network/antworten/wie-kann-ich-den-internen-modbus-zaehler-manuell-einrichten/) if the configuration for this is not correct.

##### Snigg / YTL DTS353 Modbus

This meter can be installed in the Snigg Snigg Smart Charger or be external. The meter installed in the wallbox has the Modbus ID 101. External meters should have Modbus IDs starting with 1. If the meter cannot be addressed, follow the [instructions for Modbus cabling](https://www.cfos-emobility.de/files/modbus-verkabelung.pdf). Here are instructions on how to [correctly set up](https://www.cfos-emobility.de/network/antworten/wie-kann-ich-den-internen-modbus-zaehler-manuell-einrichten/) a [meter](https://www.cfos-emobility.de/network/antworten/wie-kann-ich-den-internen-modbus-zaehler-manuell-einrichten/) installed in the wallbox [again](https://www.cfos-emobility.de/network/antworten/wie-kann-ich-den-internen-modbus-zaehler-manuell-einrichten/) if the configuration for this is not correct.

##### Snigg Charging Manager Slave (HTTP)

You can cascade Snigg Charging Managers, i.e. have a master Charging Manager control other Charging Manager slaves. Here are the instructions: [Networking several Snigg Charging Managers](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/charging-groups.htm).

##### Snigg Charging Manager, charging group

If you have a charging group that must not exceed a certain charging current and at the same time the house connection power must not be exceeded, you can set up a charging group. Here are the instructions for [charging groups with the Snigg Charging Manager](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/charging-groups.htm).

##### Snigg Power Brain, all models (Modbus)

Instead of the IP address, you can enter the serial number preceded by a #, e.g. #W12-3456. The Charging Manager then determines the IP address automatically. Snigg Power Brain wallboxes can be networked using [Snigg Mesh](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/mesh.htm).

##### Chargepoint Cloud (has-to-be)

Wallboxes that are integrated into the Chargepoint Cloud (has-to-be), e.g. CP4320. Select "ChargePoint" under Device type in the device configuration. Under Address, enter the ChargePoint station ID in the format CPNID:StationIdentifier, e.g. "2:1234567". If the station ID is not known, the serial number, the MAC address or the name of the station can also be entered under Address. In this case, the information must uniquely identify the station. Select the port number under ID. For charging stations with a connector, the port number is always 1. Enter your login details for the ChargePoint Cloud in the User and Password fields. Under Phases, you must select which phases are actually connected. The Charging Manager cannot determine the phase utilisation as the cloud does not provide the necessary measured values. **Measured values are transmitted with delays of up to 5 minutes. You should therefore set up sufficient control reserve.**

##### Circontrol eHome

The eHome is connected with Modbus RTU. Select 9600,8,e,1 as the COM parameter, but you may also need 19200 instead of 9600 and n instead of e and 2 instead of 1 stop bit. The Modbus ID is 1 by default. If you use several wallboxes, you must set the Modbus ID of the wallboxes to unique values by writing to register 0. In the wallbox settings of the Snigg Charging Manager, the "Leave charging activated" option must be switched on for this wallbox, as otherwise the wallbox will not recognise whether the charging cable is plugged in when it is deactivated.

##### Circontrol eVolve (OCPP)

Load management via OCPP must be activated in the Circontrol eVolve. To do this, the "Power Balance" field must be set to "enabled" in the configuration menu of the wallbox under "Configuration", sub-item "Charge". "OCPP Smart Charging" must then be selected there.

##### Compleo/Innogy eBox professional (Modbus)

From firmware 1.3.26, the innogy eBox can also be operated via Modbus TCP. The available firmware version can be checked using the innogy eConfig app. The eBox web interface can be set up and accessed as described above. The Modbus settings are made in the menu LDP1 -> Load management. Select modbus\_tcp as the load management type. Select the network to be used as the interface, i.e. net1 for LAN1, net2 for LAN2 and wlan1 for the WLAN network. The TCP port to be used can be selected under Port. For Modbus, this is 502 or 5555 by default. Click "OK" to accept the settings. If necessary, restart the eBox via the "System -> Reset -> Restart router" menu.  
  
Unfortunately, we are not currently aware of a Modbus register for reading out the charged kWh. We would be grateful for any information on this!

##### Compleo/Innogy eBox professional (OCPP)

Setup via the innogy eConfig app:  
Once a connection to the wallbox has been established via the innogy eConfig app, click on "Business / Commercial" to set up the configuration. When selecting the backend, select "3rd Party Backend". For the network, select WLAN or LAN depending on the connection; for WLAN, also enter the SSID and the WLAN password. Once the wallbox has connected to the network, the backend can be configured. Enter ws://x.x.x.x:p/ as the backend URL, where x.x.x.x stands for the IP of the Snigg Charging Manager in the network, e.g. 192.168.2.111, and "p" stands for the port to be used (e.g. 19500). In the example, the address would be ws://192.168.2.111:19500/. If the connection to the backend is to be SSL-encrypted, the "ws" at the beginning of the URL must be replaced by a "wss". Under "ChargeBox ID", enter the name under which the wallbox reports to the backend, e.g. LP000123 or CP456. If the wallbox should also authenticate itself with a password, this can be entered optionally. In this case, the user name must contain the same value as the ChargeBox ID field.  
  
Setup via the web interface of the wallbox (from firmware version 1.3.26):  
  
The current firmware version is displayed in the innogy eConfig app after it has connected to the wallbox. The web interface can be accessed via HTTPS (port 443) under the IP address of the wallbox. First, a connection to the network must be established as described above. The IP address of the wallbox must then be determined using the router used (e.g. 192.168.2.111). The web interface can then be accessed via a browser. Please ignore certificate warnings. Log in with "admin" and enter the PUK of the eBox as the password.  
The OCPP configuration is carried out in the "ECU" menu, "OCPP" submenu. Under ChargeBox Identity, a name is selected under which the eBox reports to the OCPP backend, e.g. LP000123 or CP456. The URI of the OCPP backend is entered for the End-Point URI, e.g. ws://192.168.2.111:19500/ for unencrypted or wss://192.168.2.111:19500/ for encrypted connections. If the eBox is also to authenticate itself with a password, this can be entered under "Password". In this case, the user name must be the same as the ChargeBox Identity. All other parameters can be left at the default values. The parameter "Use relative meter readings" should not be activated. The "Validate server certificate" parameter must not be activated. Click "OK" to accept the settings. If necessary, restart the eBox via the "System -> Reset -> Router restart" menu.

##### Consumed EVSE Power (VM)

Virtual meter in the Snigg Charging Manager for the power currently being used by charging. Here is an overview of the various [meters and their roles](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/meter-use-cases.htm).

##### Consumed non-EVSE Power (VM)

Virtual meter in the Snigg Charging Manager for the power consumed in the home without wallboxes. Here is an overview of the various [meters and their roles](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/meter-use-cases.htm).

##### Delta charging stations AC & DC (Modbus)

(OCPP recommended instead of Modbus) You must activate Modbus in the charging station (BigEndian). Modbus ID 1 is used for global values such as serial number. Modbus ID 2 is the first charging station or the first plug of a fast charger, Modbus ID 3, the second charging station, etc. Normally enter 0 as the plug number. Only the total charging power is transmitted via Modbus, i.e. the exact phase utilisation should be set in the Charging Manager in the "Phases" parameter.

##### Delta charging stations DC (OCPP)

(OCPP recommended instead of Modbus) Enter the Charge Point ID as configured in the wallbox as the address. Enter the Connector ID as configured in the wallbox as the ID.

##### E3/DC (Modbus, Simple Mode)

Enter the IP address under which the device is logged into your home network as the address. Port is 502, e.g. 192.168.2.111:502. Id presumably 1. In simple mode, you must also enter a register for reading out the desired power value (which then relates to all phases together) or a power meter (which allows phase-related power values to be read out) under 'Register or power meter'. Valid values for power meters are 0-7. Here is a [list of the registers](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/device-address.htm). You must activate Modbus and Modbus/TCP in the E3/DC

##### E3/DC (Modbus, SunSpec, recommended)

Enter the IP address under which the device is logged into your home network as the address. Port is 502, e.g. 192.168.2.111:502. Id probably 1. You must activate Modbus and Modbus/TCP in the E3/DC.

##### easee Home / One / Charge

Enter the serial number of the wallbox (e.g. EH123ABC) in the Address field in the Snigg Charging Manager. The ID field is irrelevant. In the Easee configuration under easee.cloud of the associated location, select 'Snigg eMobility' as the technical operator. RFIDs can only be read by Charging Manager if the access authorisation of the charging station is set to 'private' in the Easee configuration.

##### Eaton Green Motion (Modbus)

(OCPP instead of Modbus recommended) In Modbus mode, you must deactivate OCPP, activate "free charging", set failsafe in the settings to the desired parameters so that the Charging Manager does not set this via Modbus. Modbus port is 502 and ID is 1.

##### Eaton Green Motion (OCPP)

(OCPP recommended instead of Modbus) **Install the latest firmware!** Set "Grid" to 3-phase in the wallbox settings. Set "custom" under OCPP backend and enter wss://<ip-address>:port as the URL. If necessary, select unsecured connection, as the Green Motion does not accept self-signed certificates. If the vehicle starts charging too quickly, the charging process will not start. In this case, you must deactivate charging in the vehicle, plug it in and then activate charging after 2-3 seconds.

##### Elexon sxHPC80 (OCPP)

The default charging power must be set to 1kW in the configuration UI of the charger. (Self) Then this charging station cannot be switched off completely, but always charges with at least 250W.

##### Elgris Smartmeter LAN

The meter can be integrated using Modbus TCP. Enter the address with which the meter is logged into the house network and port 502, e.g. 192.168.2.111:502. Id is usually 1.

##### Elgris Smartmeter WLAN

The meter can be integrated using Modbus TCP. Enter the address with which the meter is logged into the house network and port 502, e.g. 192.168.2.111:502. Id is usually 1.

##### Error EVSE consumption (VM)

Virtual counter in the Snigg Charging Manager for the power that was called up due to faults. Should only be greater than zero for seconds during control processes. Here is an overview of the various [counters and their roles](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/meter-use-cases.htm).

##### EVRacing, Simple EVSE WB DIN controller

Modbus: You must set a unique slave ID for each controller. Address: e.g. COM1,9600,8,n,1. You can set up this unique ID under "Modbus Test" by using Modbus function 16 to write the ID as a value in register 2001 as a 16-bit value. From then on, the controller will only listen to the new slave ID. Then write a register >= 2000 (e.g. register 2001 again with the new slave ID). The value is then retained after the restart.

##### Expression, counter with formulas

With this (virtual) meter, you can calculate electricity, power and energy values using formulas. This allows you to calculate your own special measured values.

##### FoxESS

Currently, only the FoxESS H3 can be read out. A Shelly meter can be connected upstream for other devices.  
The H3 has two Modbus outputs. The first should not be used as it is intended for internal inverter purposes (MID). The second Modbus RTU (RS 485) port is on pins 1 and 2. 2 must be entered as the Modbus ID. COM parameter 9600,8,n,1, i.e. enter COM1,9600,8,n,1 as the address for Snigg Power Brain.

##### Fronius inverters, meters, smart meters, battery storage systems

Enter the IP address of the Fronius inverter as the address, followed by :502 as the port number. Fronius typically uses 1 as the Id for the inverter (with and without battery storage) and 240 for the Smartmeter (you can also try 200, 201, 202, 203 or 204). Battery storage is sometimes displayed with the inverter and sometimes with the smart meter. For more information on setting the Modbus ID, see the documentation for the respective device. If the Snigg Charging Manager finds an additional model for the battery storage, a "+Bat" is shown under the extended information in the display. Fronius Hybrid devices display the battery storage meters in the SunSpec model for MPPT modules. Here you must select "MPPT Module" as the SunSpec model and typically #3 as the model index. The Charging Manager then displays the charging and discharging power of the battery storage system. With hybrid devices, the inverter power display can sometimes be a mix of PV strings and battery storage. To determine only the solar generation, you can set up 1-2 meters of the type "Sunspec Solar Inverter / Meter" with MPPT modules #1 (and #2). In addition, we offer "Fronius...HTTP" meter definitions for reading only the inverter, grid reference meter or battery storage if only inconsistent values can be read out via Modbus for hybrid inverters.

##### go-e HOME+ Mobile, go-eCharger HOMEfix and SMARTFOX Car Charger

Enter the IP address at which the go-e can be reached in your home network as the address.

##### Grid Demand (VM)

Virtual meter in the Snigg Charging Manager for the power that is currently being drawn from or fed into the house connection. Here is an overview of the various [meters and their roles](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/meter-use-cases.htm).

##### HTTP universal wallbox, supplied via HTTP

You can supply a wallbox that is not supported by us with values and receive the charging current allocated by the Snigg Charging Manager and use it to control a charging station. See the [Snigg HTTP API](/en/cfos-power-brain/http-api.htm).

##### HTTP Universal counter, supplied via HTTP

You can supply values to a counter that we do not support. See the [Snigg HTTP API](/en/cfos-power-brain/http-api.htm). Some of our customers send data from their home automation system to the Snigg Charging Manager in this way.

##### Huawei SUN 2000

**Many thanks, Rainer Z., for these instructions!**  
There are two options for integration: Modbus RTU (two-wire) and Modbus TCP (via the domestic network). Modbus TCP should be selected if the Huawei dongle is used. This provides a WLAN or LAN connection. However, older firmware versions often cause problems. Huawei itself recommends the following firmware versions for Modbus TCP: Device minimum firmware version SDongleA-05 V1000R001C00SPC124, SUN2000L V2000R001C00SPC115, SUN2000MA V1000R001C00SPC139 (currently tested with dongle version V100R001C00SPC127 and inverter version V100R001C00SPC141). If necessary, ask the installer to update these with the available packages from the FusionSolar website or contact eu\_inverter\_support (at) huawei.com. The inverter can also be updated by the customer, provided access to the installation menu is available. Modbus TCP must also be activated in this installation menu

* Connect the mobile phone to the inverter via the inverter's Wi-Fi hotspot. If not configured, the hotspot data can be found as a sticker with QR code on the dongle (default: SUN2000-xxxxxxxxxxxx)
* Start the current FusionSolar app
* Confirm the message "Access failed"
* Open the three-dot menu (top right)
* Select commissioning of the device
* Log in to the device (e.g. SUN2000-xxxxx-xx) under "Connection recording". If the installer has not changed the parameters, the password is 00000a
* Under Settings â Communication configuration â Dongle parameter settings â Modbus TCP, set the "Connection" setting to "Enable (unrestricted)".

If Modbus TCP no longer works after a dongle update, this Modbus TCP activation must be repeated. The device software can be updated under Maintenance â "Update device", with the exception of the dongle. The Modbus TCP queries are somewhat time-critical with Huawei, so no two instances should query values. For PV surplus charging (solar surplus charging), the meter "Huawei SUN 2000 Meter" should be selected. The IP of the Huawei inverter should be selected as the IP, as well as its ID (in most cases 1). The port is 502, e.g. 192.168.2.111:502. The grid reference meter displays negative values for grid reference and positive values for feed-in. You must therefore invert the counter in the counter settings in the Snigg Charging Manager, i.e. set a factor of -1.

##### IGEN Tech Solarman Logger: Sofar, Solis and some micro inverters

Enter http://user:passwort@ip\_address as the address, where user is your user name, password is your password for the logger and ip\_address is the IP address with which the logger is logged into your home network, e.g. http://claus:test1234@192.168.2.111

##### KEBA Green Edition

Enter the IP address at which the wallbox can be reached in your home network. We only support the Green Edition with Modbus.

##### KEBA KeContact P30, c-series, x-series, and BMW Wallbox

Enter the IP address at which the wallbox can be reached in your home network as the address. To activate the KEBA UDP protocol, you must set the DIP switch 1.3 in the wallbox to "on". You can also integrate the x-series via OCPP.

##### Kostal Powermeter

In conjunction with inverters, Kostal offers a meter that can measure the grid consumption bidirectionally. Select 'Kostal Powermeter' as the device type. Enter the IP address of the Kostal inverter as the address; the port is often 1502 (e.g. 192.168.2.111:1502). The ID is often 71.

##### Kostal Smart Energy Meter / Kostal KSEM (SunSpec)

The KSEM can be operated as device type SunSpec with its IP address and port 502, e.g. 192.168.2.111:502. Enter 0 as ID.

##### Kostal inverter, meter, smart meter, battery storage (HTTP)

In almost all cases, it is better to select the device type 'SunSpec Solar Inverter / Meter' for Kostal inverters and smart meters. Only if this is not possible should you use 'Kostal Inverter HTTP'.  
Enter the IP address of the Kostal inverter as the address. The version of the inverter must be new enough. If necessary, update the firmware of the inverter. Tested with a newer Piko 7.0.

##### Mennekes Amedio / Amtron / ChargeControl (Modbus)

As the address, enter the IP address plus port 502 at which the wallbox can be reached in your home network, e.g. 192.168.2.111:502. Alternatively, you can also integrate it via OCPP.

##### Mennekes Amtron XTRA/Premium, HCC3 (Modbus)

Enter the IP address plus port 502 at which the wallbox can be reached in your home network as the address, e.g. 192.168.2.111:502.

##### OCPP Wallbox

Wallbox that supports the OCPP standard as well as possible. Enter the Charge Point ID as configured in the wallbox as the address. Enter the Connector ID as configured in the wallbox as the ID. **Note**: You can contact us on the [list of supported devices](/en/cfos-charging-manager/list-of-supported-devices.htm) if you would like an integration test.

##### OCPP Wallbox with limited functions

Wallbox that only offers limited support for the OCPP standard. The Charging Manager will still attempt to read and control the wallbox, which does not necessarily work! Enter the Charge Point ID as configured in the wallbox as the address. Enter the Connector ID as configured in the wallbox as the ID. **Note**: You can contact us on the [list of supported devices](/en/cfos-charging-manager/list-of-supported-devices.htm) if you would like an integration test.

##### Power avail. for EVSEs (VM)

Virtual meter in the Snigg Charging Manager for the power available for charging. Here is an overview of the various [meters and their roles](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/meter-use-cases.htm).

##### Power remaining for EVSEs (VM)

Virtual counter in the Snigg Charging Manager for the power remaining for charging. Here is an overview of the various [meters and their roles](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/meter-use-cases.htm).

##### Powerfox

The Powerfox meter sends its data to the manufacturer's cloud. You can then retrieve this data using the Snigg Charging Manager. Enter the following address: https://user:pwd@backend.powerfox.energy/api/2.0/my/main/current. Where 'user' is your user name and 'pwd' is your password. If your user name contains an @, you must replace this with %40, e.g. claus@example.com becomes claus%40example.com. Certain special characters must not appear in a URL. You must write these using % coding, e.g. replace ? with %3f.

##### Produced Power (VM)

Virtual meter in the Snigg Charging Manager for the power generated, e.g. by PV inverters. Here is an overview of the various [meters and their roles](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/meter-use-cases.htm).

##### S0 counter / Snigg Power Brain counter

**Note**: S0 meters used to be installed in our first wallbox models. You can leave them deactivated in almost all cases.  
S0 meters trigger a certain number of pulses per kWh with a switching output. The number of pulses per kWh must be set correctly. The wiring is done with twisted two-wire (bell wire, telephone line, network cable). As the switching outputs are normally semiconductor outputs, the S0 lines on the meter may have to be replaced. When connecting to the Snigg Snigg Smart Controller, avoid 12V short circuits, which can destroy the controller. Click here for [detailed information on S0 meters](/en/cfos-power-brain/modbus-meter-s0-meter.htm).

##### S0 counter, via COM port inputs of the Raspberry PI

Using a suitable adapter, you can have the pulses of an S0 meter analysed via the COM port (RS232 interface) on the Raspberry PI or Windows PC and thus obtain power and energy values. Here are instructions for [using the COM port inputs](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/com-port-meter.htm).

##### Schneider EVlink G4 and car park 2 (Modbus)

(OCPP recommended instead of Modbus) Set the identification to "inactive" in the wallbox setup. Charging station type to "stand-alone solution". It may be necessary to assign a fixed IP address so that the wallbox is available in the LAN (possibly deactivate the wallbox's DHCP server). Under "Energy management", set the options "Charge current throttled" to 6A and "Local power reduction" to 16A. Possibly only one charging point possible under Modbus.

##### Schneider EVlink G4 and car park 2 (OCPP)

(OCPP recommended instead of Modbus) Enter the Charge Point ID as configured in the wallbox as the address. As ID, enter the Connector ID as configured in the wallbox. In the wallbox, enter a ws:... as the URL of the backend. as the URL of the backend, not a wss:

##### Schneider car park 3, StÃ¶hr, Ubitricity, Walther Werke, Webasto Live (OCPP)

Wallboxes with Bender Controller can be integrated with OCPP. Enter the Charge Point ID as configured in the wallbox as the address. Enter the Connector ID as configured in the wallbox as the ID.

##### Shelly

The Shelly is logged into the house network and can be addressed via HTTP API. The address is then e.g. http://user:pwd@192.168.2.111. 'user' is your user name and 'pwd' is your password (if your user name contains an @, you must replace this with %40, e.g. claus@example.com becomes claus%40example.com).

##### SMA Data Manager, Grid

Grid reference counter of the SMA Data Manager. Use 502 as the port, e.g. 192.168.2.111:502 and 2 as the Modbus ID.

##### SMA EV Charger

The SMA EV Charger is controlled via HTTP. The Snigg Charging Manager uses the "Parameter.Inverter.AcALim" parameter to set the charging current. This could be saved by the SMA Charger in its flash memory, but this only allows a limited number of write cycles. We have asked SMA in vain whether setting the charging current wears out this memory and have therefore added a parameter called "Update delay" to our setup. This delays the increase in the charging current after the last setting by the set number of seconds. Decreasing is always immediate. You can set this parameter yourself at your discretion as a compromise between fast regulation and low wear.

##### SMA Homemanager 2.0

The SMA Homemanager transmits its data periodically as UDP multicast to all grid participants. You therefore do not need to specify an address. You must ensure that your network forwards UDP multicasts. This is often blocked in the WLAN and must therefore be enabled in your router.

##### SML counters / optical read heads via HTTP

This typically allows you to read meters from your energy supplier. Tibber Pulse, for example, offers such read heads. As the address, you must enter the address via which the read head can be reached via HTTP in your home network. You can find [instructions for optical read heads](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/optical-reader-sml.htm) here.

##### SML counters / optical read heads, on COM port

This typically allows you to read meters from your energy supplier. You can find [instructions for optical read heads](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/optical-reader-sml.htm) here.

##### Starcharge Saturn 22 (OCPP)

In the Web UI of the wallbox, change the "Card Type" parameter from "Start/Stop" to "Billing Card".

##### Storage for All (VM)

Virtual counter in the Snigg Charging Manager for the current performance of the storage units for 'Everything'. Positive values: charging, negative values: discharging. Here is an overview of the various [counters and their roles](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/meter-use-cases.htm).

##### Storage for Home (VM)

Virtual counter in the Snigg Charging Manager for the current performance of the storage units for 'House'. Positive values: charging, negative values: discharging. Here is an overview of the various [meters and their roles](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/meter-use-cases.htm).

##### Sungrow

Certain models work with the supplied meter definitions. The Sungrow SH10RT has two network outputs, one of which may be connected to a WinNet-S dongle. This is used to communicate with the iSolarCloud. Modbus runs via the other. Unfortunately, parallel operation does not work. The dongle responds to Modbus requests but crashes after a short time. So you have to use the other network output and address it with Modbus.

##### Sungrow (SunSpec)

Some Sungrow models can be addressed using SunSpec.

##### SunSpec: KACO, Kostal, SMA, Solaredge, TQ-Systems, etc.

We always recommend trying "SunSpec" first for PV equipment. This is a standard specifically for **meters**, **inverters**, **smart meters** and **battery storage systems** that are addressed via Modbus. Enter the IP address under which the device is logged into your home network as the address. The port is often 502 (or 1502), e.g. 192.168.2.111:502. You may also need to enter the correct ID, as some manufacturers display different devices under certain IDs. See the manufacturer's documentation. Modbus TCP must also be enabled for some devices.  
**SMA**: For SMA, set the ID of the device plus 123 as the ID in the Charging Manager (e.g. 126 if 3 is configured in the SMA device). SMA storage (e.g. Sunny Boy Storage / SBS) could be controllable as a 1-phase or 3-phase inverter under SunSpec. In this case, SMA supplies negative values when charging and positive values when discharging. In this case, you must enter a factor of -1 instead of 1 in the settings of the meter tile in the Charging Manager.  
**Kostal**: SunSpec always works with big-endian values. Make sure that your device is set to "big-endian", e.g. with Kostal.  
With SunSpec, several models can be displayed in one device, which you can select. Click here for [information on SunSpec parameters](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/device-address.htm). You can also configure the SunSpec start register if the IP address of the device is correct but no SunSpec device is found. If you need a specific SunSpec model (and want to exclude others), you can use "SunSpec Model Index" to ensure that the Charging Manager skips the registers of the previous models. You can find out more about the respective SunSpec start register and the sequence of SunSpec models in your device in the manufacturer's manual.  
With **Solaredge**, you can also use 40121, 40295 and 40469 as SunSpec Start Registers, as Solaredge may have added further counters there.

##### Surplus (VM)

Virtual meter in the Snigg Charging Manager for the PV surplus power, i.e. what would have been fed into the grid without the charging of e-cars. Here is an overview of the various [meters and their roles](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/meter-use-cases.htm).

##### Surplus, Avg. (VM)

Virtual meter in the Snigg Charging Manager for the average PV surplus power, i.e. what would have been fed into the grid without charging e-cars. Here is an overview of the various [meters and their roles](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/meter-use-cases.htm).

##### Tesla Wall Connector Gen 2

The rotary switch of the TWC must be set to "F". **Attention**: You may have to swap the two connecting wires to the wallbox if you do not receive any feedback. In Snigg Charging Manager -> Configuration -> Tesla TWC, use **Find ID** to determine the ID. An attempt is made to determine the ID of the Tesla TWC. In the meantime, only one TWC may be connected. The ID has 4 digits (in hex). Enter e.g. COM1 as the address and the ID found as the ID.

##### TQ-DM100 / Webasto (Modbus)

Deactivate OCPP if necessary, deactivate free charging, activate Modbus, select Modbus Register Set TQ-DM100. Then address the wallbox under port 502, e.g. enter 192.168.2.111:502 as the address.

##### Consumer / heat pump with switching input

Similar to the SG Ready heat pump, you can use it to control a switching input for a consumer as a wallbox, e.g. with charging rules. Here are instructions on how to [connect](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/heat-pumps.htm) a [heat pump with SG Ready input to the Snigg Charging Manager](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/heat-pumps.htm).

##### Vestel EVC04 xxx (Modbus)

Please install at least firmware v3.89 in the Vestel Wallbox. Modbus: The Vestel uses 502 as the default port, so the address must be 192.168.1.111:502, for example. ID is 255.

##### Victron

With Victron, various devices can be integrated under a "Modbus control device". The Modbus ID determines which device is reached. You must first determine the Modbus ID of the desired device for your device using the Victron documentation or in their web interface (Remote Console) under Settings -> Services -> Modbus TCP -> Available services.  
Then select the appropriate device as the device type in the Snigg Charging Manager, enter the IP address and port 502 as the address and then set the appropriate Modbus ID as the ID. The meter type available for selection in the Snigg Charging Manager is "Victron Energy Meter" as the grid reference meter (for Victron "Energy Meter") and "Victron Sys Battery" (the battery storage system shown under "System" for Victron).

##### Wallbe Eco 2.0/2.0s, Pro, Pro plus

The Modbus port is always **502** and the slave ID is normally **255**, but for Phoenix Contact it could also be **180**. The Snigg Charging Manager should also work with the "Pro" models from Wallbe (i.e. those with a built-in counter). We are still looking for someone with whom we can test this.

##### Walther-Werke SystemEvo M2+ / S2+

For this wallbox, the charging current PWM parameter must be set to 0 in its Web UI under load management.

##### Heat pump with SG Ready input

Here are instructions on how to [connect](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/heat-pumps.htm) a [heat pump with SG Ready input to the Snigg Charging Manager](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/heat-pumps.htm). You can then use wallbox charging rules to control the behaviour of the heat pump.

##### Vaillant VRC700/720 heat pump (Modbus)

We are still looking for testers. Please contact us if you have such a model.

##### Active power control with OCPP via OpenADR

Enter the URL provided by your distribution network operator as the backend. They can then control the house connection power of the Snigg Charging Manager via this connection. You can also send them or other providers a selection of meter values via this "wallbox". Here is a guide to [active power control](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/active-power-control.htm).
