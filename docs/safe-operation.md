Reliable and safe operation
===========================

Please observe the following safety instructions before commissioning your wallbox: The Snigg Smart Charger may only be used for charging plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles according to charging mode 3 - i.e. permanently installed. Check the wallbox, the charging cable and the vehicle's charging socket for damage before each charging process. There is a risk of electric shock if they are damaged.

The contacts of the charging cable must not come into contact with dirt or water. Prolonged contact with water can corrode the contacts.

When outdoors, make sure to protect your charging plug with the cover provided if it is hanging upwards. If it is hanging downwards, you should not use the cover to prevent water from collecting in the cover.

The charging cable must not be kinked. Do not pull the plug out of the vehicle's charging socket by the charging cable, as this can damage the connection between the cable and plug. Unwind the charging cable completely, otherwise there is a risk of overheating. It is not permitted to use the charging cable with extension cables.

Only clean the wallbox and cable with a damp cloth. Check the functionality of your residual current circuit breaker at least once a year by pressing the test button.

For commercial use, you are obliged to have the wallbox and the associated electrical installation checked annually for safety and function by qualified specialists. The inspector must provide you with a report on this, which you should keep. For private use, we recommend that you also have this inspection carried out annually.

Opening the housing, installation, electrical connection, commissioning, maintenance, repair and connection of other devices, e.g. to the RS485 interface and the S0 interfaces, may only be carried out by qualified specialist personnel.

The safety regulations applicable in the country of installation apply.

The Snigg Smart Charger may only be operated within the EU.

Charging Manager und Lastmanagement
-----------------------------------

The Snigg Charging Manager can include not only Snigg Smart Controller wallboxes, but also third-party wallboxes in the load management. A wallbox must fulfil the following requirements for this:  
- reports its maximum power to the car  
- is controllable  
- can deactivate/activate charging reports its Charge Pilot status (A-F) in accordance with DIN IEC 61851.

The following conditions must be met for reliable and safe operation of the Snigg Smart Charger operated with our software, the Snigg Smart Controller operated with our software and/or any other wallbox operated with our software:

1. The Snigg Smart Charger may only be installed by specialists authorised to do so. The installation must be carried out in accordance with the statutory regulations.
2. The wallbox connection must be protected by a suitable type A residual current circuit breaker and corresponding circuit breaker. The residual current circuit breaker must be tested at least once a year or more frequently if there is an increased risk.
3. The electrical installation must be designed in such a way that, in the event of a power overload due to malfunctions of the Snigg Charging Manager, the Snigg Smart Charger or other devices, power failures in installation areas that are intended to function independently of the wallbox are prevented. If the power is exceeded, for example, the power supply to the wallbox should be disconnected from other electrical installations.
4. The Snigg Smart Charger may only be connected to TT or TN systems. The respective grid system must have a permanently good conducting protective earth conductor (PE). Connection is only permitted in a grid system that does not require the wallbox to test the PE conductor.
5. After assembly and installation, the wallbox must be checked for safety and function by a qualified specialist.
6. Only wallboxes that report their maximum power to the car, are controllable, can activate and deactivate charging and report their charge pilot status (A-F) in accordance with DIN IEC 61851 may be integrated into our software;
7. A minimum electrical current of 6 amps per phase used must be permanently available for each charging point integrated into our software;
8. It must be ensured that our software is compatible with your respective hardware and its software (a continuously updated list of compatible devices [can be found here](/en/cfos-charging-manager/list-of-supported-devices.htm)).
