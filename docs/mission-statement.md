# About Snigg eMobility

## Who we are

CFos eMobility GmbH was founded in 2020 with the aim of facilitating access to e-mobility and accelerating the energy transition. We contribute our experience in the field of professional software development, which we have already gained at [Snigg Software GmbH](https://www.cfos.de) and its predecessor. We have been developing and selling network software there since 1993 (including [SniggSpeed](https://atlas-cfosspeed.com/)), which has since been used millions of times worldwide.

## What is important to us

We believe that electric mobility is a building block in the fight against climate change and would like to facilitate and accelerate its spread. That's why we build EVSEs for charging electric cars. Furthermore, we offer load management software for the simultaneous charging of an almost unlimited number of electric cars.

Important to us:

* EVSEs must be affordable and easily integrated into existing infrastructure.
* Load management must also be cost-effective and must not include subscription fees, otherwise electric cars are at a disadvantage compared to internal combustion vehicles in terms of parking space rental.
* We want to support the energy transition.  
  That is why the use of photovoltaics and other renewable energies is particularly close to our hearts. Our products support grid-serving control, i.e. preferential charging when there is a surplus of energy and delayed or throttled charging when there is a lack of energy in the power grid.

We regularly adapt our products to current changes in the market. For the software in our EVSEs and our load management, there are lifelong free updates with new functions and bug fixes.

We have #thebestuseroftheworld. Our customers give us important feedback and help us with suggestions, tests and the integration of new devices. We are very grateful for this!  
To stay in touch with our customers, we have the [Snigg Network](/network/).

## Who we work with

Since we cannot achieve our ambitious goals alone, we are interested in partnerships with other companies.  
Our products are in-house developments and currently cover the following areas:

* EVSEs for private and commercial use
* Load management for optimal use of the available power for simultaneous charging of several electric cars
* OCPP gateway (for connecting non-OCPP-compliant wallboxes) and OCPP backend
* App with cloud support for Android and iPhone
* Own charge controller: The Snigg Snigg Smart Controller
* PV Surplus Charging (Solar Surplus Charging)
* Communication via smart meter gateway, integration with energy suppliers and grid operators, grid-serving control
* Transmission of meter readings in conformity with calibration law
