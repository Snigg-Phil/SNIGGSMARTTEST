Snigg Charging Manager with and without meter

The Snigg Charging Manager always distributes the maximum house connection power to the EVSEs that are actually charging.

EVSE **without** meter**:**  
The Snigg Charging Manager assumes here that the car always uses the entire charging current offered. You can use the "Phases" option to set the phases with which the car charges. If the car does not accept the power offered in this way, the Charging Manager cannot make it available to other cars.

EVSE **without energy meter:**  
If the EVSE does not have a meter for the charged kWh, the Snigg Charging Manager calculates the charged energy approximately from the charging current and the charging time (soft meter).

EVSE **with S**0 meter**:**  
The Snigg Charging Manager knows at which power the car is currently charging and can make unclaimed power available to other cars. Since S0 meters only send pulses per kWh, the Charging Manager cannot know on which phase charging is taking place. You should use the "Phases" option to set which phases are actually used. Since the Snigg Charging Manager looks at the charging currents for all 3 phases individually, it can then allocate the available current to cars charging on other phases.  
You should definitely connect several EVSEs with phase rotation to avoid peak currents on individual phases and also inform the Snigg Charging Manager of this in the EVSE configuration under "Phase rotation". If you charge different vehicles that use different phases, inaccuracies may occur and you should set a control reserve in the Snigg Charging Manager settings.

EVSE **with phase-accurate** meter**:**  
If the EVSE measures the current used by the car per phase, the Snigg Charging Manager can accurately calculate the resulting charging current for all EVSEs. You therefore do not need to set a control reserve even if you charge with different vehicles.

EVSEs **with** attached meter**:**  
If the EVSE does not have a meter, you can (have) an external meter installed in the supply line, add it as a device in the Snigg Charging Manager and then "pin" it in the EVSE settings of the EVSE. This EVSE will then appear to the Snigg Charging Manager as one with a built-in meter.

**Snigg Snigg Smart Charger:**  
The Snigg Snigg Smart Charger is available with either a built-in or external meter. If you want to use the external meter to measure the EVSE power, you should attach it (see above). For Snigg Snigg Smart Chargers that are operated as slaves, you should attach the meter in the slave. The EVSE will then appear as a EVSE with a built-in meter.

Meter **for domestic consumption:**  
Without a consumption meter, the Snigg Charging Manager cannot know how much the domestic connection is really loaded with its maximum power. In this case, you must enter the power that is available to the EVSE at all times as the maximum house connection power in the Charging Manager settings, regardless of which other consumers exist -> Static load management. In many cases this is sufficient. In many cases, however, the available household power is only used as household consumption at peak times and can be used to charge the cars during the remaining hours. In this case, it is advisable to install a meter that measures the household consumption without the EVSE. It is best to install a 3-phase resolving meter, otherwise you will have to plan for a power reserve. Then, in the Snigg Charging Manager settings, enter the value that you have ordered from your energy supplier for your house as the maximum house connection power. The Snigg Charging Manager then makes this power, minus the current power that the house currently needs, available to the EVSEs in the correct phase. Such a meter has the role "consumption" in the Charging Manager.  
In this way, you can save yourself an increase in the house connection power and the associated upgrade costs and construction cost subsidies in many cases.

**Meters for large currents:**  
For currents up to approx. 80-100 A you can use direct-measuring meters. Here, the phases are passed through the meter. For this, the meter must be designed to withstand the currents permanently.  
In large houses, higher currents occur, so it is easier to run the phases through so-called meter transformers. These are coils in which a current is induced when current flows on the lines of the individual phases. The transformer meter can then measure this induced current. There are even models that are particularly small because they then do not have to have large terminals (1-2 division units).  
In apartment buildings, you can also install such transformer meters in the "sealed" area in the meter cabinets or in a NH distributor in consultation with the energy supplier. This is easier than many people think! Such meters with measuring coils are called transformer meters.

**Meter for generation:**  
If you operate a solar power system (PV) or a CHP unit and make the generated power available to the wallboxes, you can configure a generation meter in the Snigg Charging Manager. You can either install an external meter or use the inverter(s) of your solar system as a meter. The Snigg Charging Manager then calculates the charging power available to the wallboxes as above (for meters for domestic consumption), adding the current generation power to the wallboxes. You should set such meters in the Charging Manager with the "Generation" role.  
**Note for hybrid inverters:** Some hybrid inverters report a value as generation power that is distorted by the storage power. To correct this, the Snigg Charging Manager offers a "Hybrid inverter" option. Please note that hybrid inverters with the "Generation" role only display the power of the PV system.

If you have meters **for** consumption (and generation), you do not necessarily need meters for the EVSE, because the Snigg Charging Manager assumes (see above) that the EVSE will always take the power offered to them.  
Instead of installing meters for domestic consumption (and for generation), you can also install a central meter directly at the house connection point. If there is a generation plant in your house, this meter must be bidirectional! It then has the role of "grid reference".  
The Snigg Charging Manager then calculates the household consumption by subtracting the EVSE consumption from the value measured with this grid reference meter. To do this, you need either a meter in all EVSEs or a total meter for all EVSEs ("E-car consumption" role). Without a EVSE meter, the household consumption would otherwise be potentially underestimated.

**Meter for the solar surplus:**  
The easiest way to measure the solar surplus is to use a bidirectional(!) grid reference meter (see above) and meter(s) for all wallboxes. You can then configure a charging rule for surplus charging in the Snigg Charging Manager. Alternatively, you can also install consumption and generation meters (often the inverter of your solar system). For more information, see [PV Surplus Charging (Solar Surplus Charging)](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/surplus-charging.htm).

**Virtual** meters**:**  
The Snigg Charging Manager offers the following "virtual" meters:

* "Consumed EVSE Power" Total consumption of all currently charging EVSEes
* "Consumed non-EVSE Power" Total of all consumers without EVSEes
* "Grid Demand Calculated or measured grid demand
* "Power avail. for EVSEs" Power available to all EVSEes
* "Power remaining for EVSEs" Remaining (unused) power for EVSEes
* "Produced Power" Sum of all producers
* "Produced Power, AVG" Sum of all producers, moving average
* "Surplus" Calculated solar surplus
* "Surplus, AVG" Calculated solar surplus, moving average

You can additionally set these up to have an overview of these values.

**Advanced** meters**:**  
The virtual meter of the type "Expression" allows to compose meter values from other meter values by means of formulas. For more information, see Formulas [for](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/formulas.htm) Meters [and Loading Rules](/en/cfos-charging-manager/documentation/formulas.htm).

HTTP input meter**:**  
If the Snigg Charging Manager does not support a specific meter, you can set up an HTTP input meter and feed it with HTTP requests with the relevant values. See [Snigg Charging Manager HTTP API](/en/cfos-power-brain/http-api.htm).
